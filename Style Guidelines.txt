	GUIDELINES for both front end and back end:

	1 - We will use prettier code formatter without any tweaks.

	2 - Then => catch preferred (required?) over async -> await.

	3 - Export React components at the bottom of its file.

	4 - Always use destructuring where applicable.

	5 - Place class methods after return so we can see what a class is doing without having to scroll down.

	6 - Use error instead of err in the catch statements, and be descriptive with variable declarations in general.
